# stock-prediction-using-rnn
The stock market has evolved.Leveraging on deep learning  has proven  more effective way  to predict the direction of the stock prices.

I used the recurrent neural network(RNN)  to build a deep learning model because of its effectiveness in remembering previous timestamps due to the presence of the LSTMS(Long-Short term memory)
I initialized the RNN .
I trained the RNN using tensorflow backend
Then tested the predicted model by parsing new data..
After, the results were visualized to have a more general understanding..
